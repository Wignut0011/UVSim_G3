|              UVSim runs in 2 modes; Editing Mode and Execution Mode. When the simulator                             |
|              launches, you will be in Editing Mode. Here you will input your instructions (code)                    |
|              as signed 4 digit decimal numbers one line at a time. Please see section Editing                       |
|              Mode for further detail. When you are finished inputing your instructions, input                       |
|              -99999. This ends Editing Mode and starts Execution Mode. In Execution Mode, the                       |
|              simulator will run the instructions you had previously input in Editing Mode then                      |
|              display a memory dump after it's finished.                                                             |
