|          In Execution Mode, the simulator will start to execute the instructions you had put into                    |
|          it's memory. Depending on your instructions, you may be prompted to input a number during                   |

|          Execution Mode will end and a dump of the memory and each register will be printed on the                   |
|          screen. To use the simulator again, you will need to re-launch UVSim.                                       |
